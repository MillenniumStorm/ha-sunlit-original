## Energy Dashboard Integration

To integrate with HomeAssistant's Energy Dashboard:

### Solar Production

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Dashboards** ‚Üí **Energy**
2. Under **Solar Panels**, click **Add Solar Production**
3. Select sensor: `sensor.inverter_[ID]_total_power_generation`

### Grid Consumption

1. Under **Grid**, click **Add Consumption**
2. Select sensor: `sensor.meter_[ID]_total_buy_energy`

### Grid Return

1. Under **Grid**, click **Add Return**
2. Select sensor: `sensor.meter_[ID]_total_ret_energy`

### Battery Energy (using Riemann sum helper)

Since the integration provides power sensors but not energy sensors for batteries:

1. Create a helper: **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services** ‚Üí **Helpers** ‚Üí **Create Helper** ‚Üí **Integration - Riemann sum**
2. Configure:
   - Name: "Battery Energy Input"
   - Input sensor: `sensor.battery_[ID]_input_power_total`
   - Integration method: Trapezoidal
   - Metric prefix: k (kilo)
   - Time unit: Hours
3. Repeat for output power
4. Add these helpers to Energy Dashboard under **Battery Storage**

## Entity Design

### Entity ID Naming Convention

All entities follow a consistent naming pattern to ensure uniqueness across multiple families and devices:

#### Family/Space Level Entities

Pattern: `sensor.sunlit_{family_id}_{sensor_key}`
Example: `sensor.sunlit_12345_battery_level`

#### Device Level Entities

Pattern: `sensor.sunlit_{family_id}_{device_type}_{device_id}_{sensor_key}`
Example: `sensor.sunlit_12345_battery_456_input_power_total`

#### Virtual Device Entities (Battery Modules)

Pattern: `sensor.sunlit_{family_id}_battery_{device_id}_module{N}_{sensor_key}`
Example: `sensor.sunlit_12345_battery_456_module1_soc`

### Device Hierarchy

The integration creates a hierarchical device structure:

1. **Family Hub** - Virtual device representing the entire solar system

   - Contains aggregate sensors and system-wide metrics
   - All physical devices are linked to this hub

2. **Physical Devices** - Actual hardware components

   - Smart meters (SHELLY_3EM_METER)
   - Inverters (YUNENG_MICRO_INVERTER)
   - Battery units (ENERGY_STORAGE_BATTERY)

3. **Virtual Devices** - Logical representations for better organization
   - Battery modules (1-3) for modular battery systems
   - Each module appears as a separate device linked to the main battery unit
   - Prevents sensor overload on single devices (30+ sensors)

### Modular Battery Architecture

For battery systems with expansion modules:

- **Main Unit (BK215)**: Contains system-wide sensors and dual MPPT inputs
- **B215 Module 1-3**: Additional battery packs (2.15 kWh each) with individual MPPT solar inputs
- Each module tracks its own SOC and solar production independently
- Virtual devices ensure clean organization in HomeAssistant UI

## Known Limitations

- **No Dynamic Device Discovery**: New devices added to your Sunlit system require a HomeAssistant restart to appear
- **No Historical Data**: The integration cannot backfill historical data from before it was installed
- **API Rate Limits**: The 30-second update interval is fixed to avoid API rate limiting
- **Read-Only**: All sensors are read-only; device control is not supported

## Troubleshooting

### Enable Debug Logging

Add to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.sunlit: debug
```

### Common Issues

**Sensors showing "unavailable"**

- Check your internet connection
- Verify API key is correct
- Ensure devices are online in Sunlit Solar app

**Missing devices after adding new hardware**

- Restart HomeAssistant to discover new devices
- Check if devices appear in Sunlit Solar app first

**Energy Dashboard not showing data**

- Ensure sensors have `state_class: total_increasing` (check Developer Tools)
- Wait for at least one update cycle (30 seconds)
- Verify units are in kWh for energy sensors
